# GoodReads Modelling Part

This part of project is on the modelling data and modeling steps.

## Setup

Before running this notebook, make sure to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Suppressing Warnings

To maintain clarity and readability, warnings from various libraries are suppressed throughout the notebook.

## Pandas Display Settings

Pandas settings are adjusted to ensure comprehensive visibility of the dataset during analysis, including settings for displaying all rows and columns and formatting floating-point numbers.

## Dataset

The dataset, named `books_features_enhanced.csv`, presumably contains an enriched set of features about books. It is loaded for analysis or modeling purposes:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/books_features_enhanced.csv")
```

Replace `"path/to/your/books_features_enhanced.csv"` with the actual path to the dataset on your machine.

## Analysis or Modeling Process

The notebook explores the enhanced dataset through various advanced techniques, which may include:

- Detailed exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Applying machine learning models

Each step of the process is detailed, with explanations for the choice of techniques and their implementation using the aforementioned libraries.
