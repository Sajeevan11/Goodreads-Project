# GoodReads Data Cleaning Project

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing data from GoodReads, a popular book review and recommendation platform. The goal is to enhance the quality of the dataset for further analysis, insights extraction, and machine learning applications. This notebook outlines the steps taken to clean various aspects of the data, including handling missing values, normalizing text, and correcting inconsistencies.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. Additionally, the project relies on the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can start the Jupyter Notebook server with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the project directory and open the `GoodReads_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` notebook. The notebook is self-contained and includes comments guiding you through each step of the data cleaning process.
